# economy-class-classifer
In this I trained a machine learning model on a data of people in which I have to predict whether a person is economiaclly active on the basis of the data so I trained a xg boost classifier model on that data and **deplyed this as web app on the heroku platfrom** So now it can be use from the we url **https://economyclassifier.herokuapp.com/** for the further prediction of other data.
